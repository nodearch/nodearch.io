# What is NodeArch?

NodeArch is a modern, lightly opinionated `Node.js` backend framework that helps developers build scalable and maintainable server-side applications using the architectural patterns and design philosophies found in enterprise-level platforms like `Java Spring` and `.NET`.

It leverages `TypeScript`, embraces `Dependency Injection`, and promotes `modular architecture`—bringing structure, consistency, and flexibility to backend development in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Why Use NodeArch?

Backend development in `Node.js` often involves assembling various tools and libraries like routers, dependency containers, config loaders, logging libraries, and middlewares. NodeArch aims to be the glue that binds these components together cleanly and intuitively—without reinventing the wheel.

With NodeArch, you:

- Use declarative, readable patterns that are easy to scale and test
- Avoid messy app structures and spaghetti code in large projects
- Retain the freedom of native `Node.js` while adding architectural guardrails

## Built on Familiar Concepts

NodeArch borrows proven ideas from mature ecosystems:

- **Modules** – For encapsulation and separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection** – For flexibility and testability
- **Decorators** – For clean and declarative code
- **Lifecycle Hooks** – For fine-grained control over app behavior
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** – For bootstrapping and scaffolding with speed

## NodeArch Works With You, Not Against You

NodeArch doesn't lock you into proprietary tools. Instead, it integrates seamlessly with:

- `Express` or other HTTP servers
- Your choice of ORMs like `TypeORM`, `Prisma`, or `Sequelize`
- Tools like `Redis`, `BullMQ`, `Kafka`, `PostgreSQL`, and more

You're free to bring your stack, while NodeArch provides the architecture to wire it all together elegantly.

## Who is NodeArch For?

- Developers tired of writing boilerplate and reinventing app structure
- Teams working on large-scale `Node.js` applications
- Engineers coming from `Java`/`C#` who want familiar patterns in `JS`/`TS`
- Framework authors looking for a clean foundation to extend
